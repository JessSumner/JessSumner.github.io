I was asked yesterday in an interview which of my projects were live on the web. I was so annoyed with myself that I could not say that my best project was up on Heroku. As soon as I could get back to my computer I deployed my project for Any Rat Rescue to [staging](http://any-rat-rescue-staging.herokuapp.com/).

This project is near and dear to my heart. Any Rat Rescue is an organization that I support and volunteer for remotely. They currently have a live website however I felt I could build an application that could do more for them.

At this point in my project you can look at available pets. My application uses the petfinder API so that any changes made to petfinder automatically update on my site. On my site you can view a small picture and their names. If you click on a particular rat you will be redirected to that rat on petfinder so you can see more information.

My application has a resources page which includes plenty of information on vets and good sites for general rat advice. Each resource, where possible, has contact information as well as a google map reference. It is this section that I wrote a previous post about "A Challenge of Data".

The home page of my application has information about the rescue, how they started etc. I have linked to their facebook page as we have some very active members who regularly post information there.

I am currently working on the adoption application form. Anyone who is interested in adopting a rat must fill out a form. Currently this is done with a pen and paper, I believe there is a link to a pdf but nothing that can be filled out immediately. I would like to save some trees and have adopters fill out the form online and have the completed either emailed to the rescue staff or create an admin portal where staff can access them. I feel not only is this greener but much more user friendly. 

Progress on this form is happening on its own branch. I have added all the content of the form to the site. It still needs formating and then I will need to establish what exactly I am going to do with the data from the completed forms. I anticipate a blog post on this process so watch this space. In the meantime please feel free to check out the app in staging.
