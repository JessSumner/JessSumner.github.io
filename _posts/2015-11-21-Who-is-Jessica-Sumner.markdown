As of this moment I am a budding Ruby on Rails developer. I was introduced to Ruby on Rails after signing up for Railsbridge in Boston. I thoroughly enjoyed the weekend and the glimpse of the community and I decided to learn more. At first my intention was to learn something to keep my brain cells from turning to mush. However the more I learnt the stronger my desire to code full time became. I have now set myself the goal of becoming a Ruby on Rails developer.

Other passions of mine include a great love of animals. I have two very cute and mischievious dogs. I volunteer remotely for Any Rat Rescue in Arizona by producing monthly fliers to advertize rats looking for a loving home. Rats make wonderful pets. Of the rodent family they are the most friendly, social and trainable. I love to cook and bake, which goes down well with my family. Finally I enjoy playing board games, one of my favorites being Galaxy Trucker - a game where you build a spaceship out of tile components and then travel across the galaxy encountering pirates, asteroid, planets and other catastophes!

I intend to use this blog to consolidate my learning. As I come across concepts which I find particularly challenging or interesting I will write a post. I welcome constructive feedback on accuracy and clarity.

Thank you for reading me!
